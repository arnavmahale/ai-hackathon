- [Enforce JWT validation for API endpoints] sample_api.py:8:0 — Every API endpoint must verify JWT authentication before processing requests to prevent unauthorized access. (function `get_users` missing auth decorator)
    Fix:
    @app.route('/api/users')
    @require_auth
    def get_users():
        return users
- [Ensure all try/catch blocks log errors] sample_api.py:21:4 — All try/catch blocks must log errors with context. Empty catch blocks are not allowed. (handler missing logger call)
    Fix:
    try:
        risky_operation()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(json.dumps({'error': str(e), 'context': {'user_id': user_id}}))
- [Check for 80% test coverage] sample_api.py:1:0 — All code must have at least 80% test coverage to ensure reliability and reduce bugs.
    Fix:
    Increase test cases to achieve at least 80% coverage.
- [Enforce camelCase for function names] sample_api.py:8:0 — All function names must use camelCase (e.g., getUserData, calculateTotal). This improves code consistency and readability. (found `get_users`)
    Fix:
    Rename to: getUsers
- [Enforce camelCase for function names] sample_api.py:18:0 — All function names must use camelCase (e.g., getUserData, calculateTotal). This improves code consistency and readability. (found `risky_handler`)
    Fix:
    Rename to: riskyHandler
- [Enforce UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants] sample_api.py:3:0 — All constants must use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_RETRIES, API_SECRET_KEY) to distinguish them from variables. (found `app`)
    Fix:
    MAX_RETRIES = 5
- [Ensure file names use kebab-case] sample_api.py:1:0 — All file names must use kebab-case (e.g., user-manager.py, payment-processor.js) for consistency. (found `sample_api.py`)
    Fix:
    user-manager.py
- [Ensure all functions have docstrings] sample_api.py:14:0 — Every function must have a docstring that describes its purpose and parameters to improve documentation. (function `getSecureData`)
    Fix:
    def my_function():
        """This function does something."""
        pass
- [Ensure all functions have docstrings] sample_api.py:18:0 — Every function must have a docstring that describes its purpose and parameters to improve documentation. (function `risky_handler`)
    Fix:
    def my_function():
        """This function does something."""
        pass
- [Check for 80% test coverage] sample_utils.py:1:0 — All code must have at least 80% test coverage to ensure reliability and reduce bugs.
    Fix:
    Increase test cases to achieve at least 80% coverage.
- [Enforce camelCase for function names] sample_utils.py:9:0 — All function names must use camelCase (e.g., getUserData, calculateTotal). This improves code consistency and readability. (found `helper_function`)
    Fix:
    Rename to: helperFunction
- [Enforce camelCase for function names] sample_utils.py:5:4 — All function names must use camelCase (e.g., getUserData, calculateTotal). This improves code consistency and readability. (found `process_request`)
    Fix:
    Rename to: processRequest
- [Enforce PascalCase for class names] sample_utils.py:1:0 — All class names must use PascalCase (e.g., UserManager, PaymentProcessor). This ensures clarity and consistency. (found `user_manager`)
    Fix:
    class UserManager:
        pass
- [Ensure file names use kebab-case] sample_utils.py:1:0 — All file names must use kebab-case (e.g., user-manager.py, payment-processor.js) for consistency. (found `sample_utils.py`)
    Fix:
    user-manager.py
- [Ensure all functions have docstrings] sample_utils.py:9:0 — Every function must have a docstring that describes its purpose and parameters to improve documentation. (function `helper_function`)
    Fix:
    def my_function():
        """This function does something."""
        pass
- [Ensure all functions have docstrings] sample_utils.py:2:4 — Every function must have a docstring that describes its purpose and parameters to improve documentation. (function `__init__`)
    Fix:
    def my_function():
        """This function does something."""
        pass
- [Ensure all functions have docstrings] sample_utils.py:5:4 — Every function must have a docstring that describes its purpose and parameters to improve documentation. (function `process_request`)
    Fix:
    def my_function():
        """This function does something."""
        pass
